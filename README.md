## Data Science Projects
* [Predicting Heart Disease Rate in the US](https://github.com/samdomeier/Springboard-projects/tree/master/Predicting_Heart_Disease_Rate)
> The goal of this project is to predict the rate of heart disease (per 100,000 individuals) for any given county in the United States based on socioeconomic indicators scraped from the USDA ERS website. According to NCHS figures from a 2018 study, heart disease was considered the leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming more than 650,000 American lives. The intention is that this model can be used to identify whether or not county administration needs to put more of a focus on heart-health in their communities. It can be a useful data-driven tool when deciding whether or not there need to be more facilities to help treat heart disease specific illnesses, or instill programs to better heart-health in their counties and school districts. Excellent examples of programs that are actively used in U.S. schools today are the Kids Heart Challenge and ShapeUpUS.

* [Foreign Exchange Binary Trading Model](https://github.com/samdomeier/Springboard-projects/tree/master/forex_binary_trading_classification)
> The goal of this project is to try and create a binary classification model for trading foreign exchange currencies. This model was created for a style of trading called binary trading - essentially executing a trade based on whether or not you think price will go up or down from where it is in that moment. Binary trading allows for a fixed win/loss amount (win is roughly 70-80% of original position, loss is full position), where the length of a typical position is anywhere from 1-30 minutes.

* [Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis of Pulmonary Embolisms Using DICOM Data](https://github.com/samdomeier/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/CT%20Image%20Analysis/CT%20Image%20Analysis.ipynb)
