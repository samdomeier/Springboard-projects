# Predicting Heart Disease Rate (PHDR)

## Table of Contents


## Project Overview
The goal is to predict the rate of heart disease (per 100,000 individuals) across the United States at the county-level from other socioeconomic indicators. Data was scraped from the USDA ERS website.

The target column is labeled `heart_disease_mortality_per_100k` which is in the 'Training_labels.csv' file.

For more reference, you can access the original kaggle dataset here: [Predicting heart disease rate](https://www.kaggle.com/nandvard/microsoft-data-science-capstone).

## Project Structure
This project consists of 4 major notebooks:
* [Compressed notebook](https://github.com/samdomeier/Springboard-projects/blob/master/Predicting_Heart_Disease_Rate/PHDR_compressed_notebook.ipynb)
* [Detailed notebook](https://github.com/samdomeier/Springboard-projects/blob/master/Predicting_Heart_Disease_Rate/PHDR_detailed_notebook.ipynb)
* [Data wrangling and EDA](https://github.com/samdomeier/Springboard-projects/blob/master/Predicting_Heart_Disease_Rate/PHDR_data_wrangling_and_EDA.ipynb)
* [Creating the model](https://github.com/samdomeier/Springboard-projects/blob/master/Predicting_Heart_Disease_Rate/PHDR_creating_the_model.ipynb)

#### Compressed Notebook 
The compressed notebook contains a shortened version of the overall project. It will include partial EDA, full data wrangling/cleaning, and the final model with results.
